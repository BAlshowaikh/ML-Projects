# üß† Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of Machine Learning projects developed entirely in **Google Colab**. It includes work in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Computer Vision**, **Classification**, **Regression**, and **Time Series Forecasting**. All notebooks were created independently, showcasing practical skills using Python and popular ML libraries.

> ‚öôÔ∏è Core technology: **TensorFlow**  
> üìö Supporting libraries: `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `Keras`
