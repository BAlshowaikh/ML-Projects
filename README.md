# üß† Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning -natural language processing (NLP), Computer Vision, Classification, Regression- projects developed entirely in Google Colab. All notebooks were created and implemented independently, demonstrating hands-on skills in computer vision, NLP, and neural network classification using Python and relevant libraries -Core Technology used is TensorFlow, other libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn-.

## üìÅ Notebooks Overview

### 1. [Intro_to_NLP.ipynb](./Intro_to_NLP.ipynb)
A beginner-friendly walkthrough into Natural Language Processing, including:
- Text preprocessing
- Tokenization
- Word embeddings

### 2. [Introduction_to_computer_vision.ipynb](./Introduction_to_computer_vision.ipynb)
Hands-on project in computer vision using Colab and TensorFlow/Keras:
- Image classification
- CNN architecture basics
- Evaluation of results

### 3. [Neural_Network_Classification_TF.ipynb](./Neural_Network_Classification_TF.ipynb)
A simple neural network for classification tasks:
- Built using TensorFlow
- Dense layers and softmax
- Accuracy and loss visualizations

### 4. [SkimLitProject.ipynb](./SkimLitProject.ipynb)
An advanced NLP project that aims to make reading abstarct papers (medical papers) more easier and efficient by classifying each sentence to a label (Background, Objective, Methods, Results, Conclusion)
- Uses PubMed dataset
- Combines LSTM layers and embedding
- Deep learning applied to research text

## üöÄ How to Run
